Python Puzzle
Compose the largest single-row digital puzzle.
Do you like puzzles? Let's make a digital puzzle with you, where the elements of the connection will be the first or last TWO digits. To simplify the task, we will use a single-row puzzle, where its fragments can only be placed following each other.

For example, we have the following strings with numbers:

608017, 248460, 962282, 994725, 177092

Solution:

Analyzing the final parts, you can make such a chain:

248460 & 608017 & 177092 -> 2484(60)80(17)7092

So the biggest sequence and answer would be: 24846080177092

The text file has 142 fragments, which should consist only of numbers! Define the longest sequence for these fragments. The file can be downloaded here.

Each fragment should be used only 1 time.
